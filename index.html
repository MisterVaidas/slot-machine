        <h3>Classic Fruit Machines: A Brief History</h3>
        

        <p>Fruit machines, also known as slot machines, are a type of casino game that has been around for centuries. The first fruit 
        machines were invented in the late 19th century, and they quickly became popular in pubs and arcades all over the world.<br>
        Early fruit machines were relatively simple devices. They typically had three reels with symbols such as fruits, bells, and stars. 
        Players would insert a coin and spin the reels. If they landed three matching symbols, they would win a prize.<br>
        Over the years, fruit machines have become more complex and feature-rich. Modern fruit machines often have multiple reels, paylines, 
        and bonus features. They may also be linked together to form progressive jackpots, which can offer huge payouts.<br>
        Despite their technological advances, classic fruit machines still retain their appeal. They are simple to play and offer a chance 
        to win big prizes. They are also a great way to relax and have some fun.</p>

        <h3>How Do Classic Fruit Machines Work?</h3>
        <p>Classic fruit machines are based on a random number generator (RNG). The RNG is a computer program that generates a series of 
        numbers. These numbers are used to determine the outcome of each spin.<br>
        When you spin the reels of a fruit machine, the RNG generates a new set of numbers. These numbers determine which symbols will 
        appear on the reels. If you land three matching symbols, you will win a prize.<br>
        The odds of winning a prize on a fruit machine vary depending on the game. Some games have higher odds of winning than others.</p>

        <h3>Types of Classic Fruit Machines</h3>
        <p>There are many different types of classic fruit machines available. Some of the most popular types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3-reel fruit machines: These machines have three reels and a few paylines. They are the simplest type of fruit machine and are often found in pubs and arcades.</li>
            <li>5-reel fruit machines: These machines have five reels and more paylines than 3-reel machines. They offer higher odds of winning and are often found in casinos.</li>
            <li>Multi-line fruit machines: These machines have multiple paylines, which means that you can win by landing matching symbols on any of the paylines. They offer higher 
                odds of winning than single-line machines.</li>
            <li>Progressive jackpot fruit machines: These machines are linked together to form a single jackpot. The jackpot grows larger and larger as more players play the game. 
                The jackpot is eventually won by a lucky player.</li>
        </ul>
